                                            one day I sat down, I recalled my experiences. I remember the incident some time ago. many things happened in this short time. when I was in elementary school, I used to play with my friends. there were older and some younger. sometimes some of us try to explore various places or try various things. at that time I get various experiences, from the introduction of computer games, exploration, togetherness, and various other experiences. but everything changed, as time went on, little by little it was just a memory of the past. when I went to junior high school. me and my best friend, school in different places, even though we went to school in different places we still play together though very rarely but I enjoy it . although in the end I played alone. I think I enjoyed my solitude between the Grade 8 or 9 .When I was in junior high school I was introduced to anime, and I was also introduced to various android games. The android games that helped me and who gave me various experiences were iruna online . From anime I know many things and from iruna online I also know a lot of things too. When I junior high I follow extracurricular called PMR, at the same time I follow jiu jitsu. his training schedule is not on the same day and his training is not difficult. Until one day my body condition decreased and I did not go to school. In the end I decided to get out of pmr and jiu jitsu. I did not know my decision was true or not and when my classmate was with my friend pmr.when I knew we were going to camp I planned to tell him the reason why i resigned. but we are not camping and I never mention it.

                                            I Wandered Lonely as a Cloudby William Wordsworth (1770-1850)I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high o'er vales and hills,When all at once I saw a crowd, A host, of golden daffodils,Beside the lake, beneath the trees,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.Continuous as the stars that shine And twinkle on the milk way,They stretched in never-ending lineAlong the margin of a bay:Ten thousand saw I at a glance, Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.The waves beside them danced; but theyOut-did the sparkling waves in glee; A poet could not but be gay, In such a jocund company; I gazed and gazed but little thoughtWhat wealth the show to me had brought:For oft, when on my couch I lieIn vacant or in pensive mood, They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the daffodils.Answer the questions based on the poem above: 1.

I started reading A Hundred Years of Solitude recently. It's by someone called Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Have you read it? It's quite a well-known book ... It's been made into a film, actually. It's about this family who have all these problems and about the history of this town called Macondo. I think I read that it's based on Marquez's own life. People say it's amazing, but actually I found it boring. It has hundreds of names and people and it just goes on and on. I won't spoil the ending because ... Well ...

Daffodils by William Wordsworth
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed--and gazed--but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought
For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.

THE STORY OF LAYLA AND MAJNUN
Qays ibn al-Mulawwah was just a boy when he fell deeply in love with Layla Al-Aamiriya. He was sure of
this love on the very first day he laid eyes upon her at school. He soon began to write beautiful love poems about
Layla and he would read them out loud on street corners to anybody who would care to listen. Such passionate
displays of love and devotion caused many to refer to the boy as Majnun, meaning madman.
One day, Majnun found the courage to ask Layla’s father for his daughter’s hand in marriage, but her
father refused the request. Such a marriage, the father reasoned, would only cause a scandal. It would not be
proper for his daughter to marry a person whom everybody called 'madman'. Instead, Layla was promised to
another.
Majnun was overcome with grief and abandoned his home and family and disappeared into the
wilderness. He lived a miserable life of solitude among the wild animals, spending his days composing poems to
his beloved Layla. Layla was forced to marry another man and, although she did not love him because her heart
still belonged to Majnun, she remained a faithful wife.
The news of this marriage was devastating to Majnun who continued to live a life of solitude, refusing to
return home to his mother and father in the city.
Majnun’s mother and father missed their son terribly and longed every day for his safe return home.
They would leave food for him at the bottom of the garden in the hopes that one day he would come back to
them out of the desert. But Majnun remained in the wilderness, writing his poetry in solitude, never speaking to
a single soul.
Majnun spent all of his time alone, surrounded only by the animals of the wilderness that gathered
around him and protected him during the long desert nights. He was often seen by travellers who would pass
him on their way towards the city. The travellers said that Majnun spent his days reciting poetry to himself and
writing in the sand with a long stick; they said that he truly was driven to madness with a broken heart.
Many years later, Majnun’s father and mother both passed away. Knowing of his devotion to his parents,
Layla was determined to send Majnun word of their passing. Eventually she found an old man who claimed to
5
have seen Majnun in the desert. After much begging and pleading the old man agreed to pass on a message the
next time he set off on his travels.
One day, the old man crossed paths with Majnun in the desert. There he solemnly delivered the news
concerning the death of Majnun’s parents and was forced to witness what a terrible blow this was to the young
poet.
Overcome with regret and loss, Majnun cut himself off from the world entirely and vowed to live in the
desert until his own death.
Some years later, Layla’s husband died. The young woman hoped that finally she would be with her one
true love; that finally she and Majnun would be together forever. But sadly, this was not to be. Tradition
demanded that Layla remain in her home alone to grieve for her dead husband for two whole years without
seeing another soul. The thought of not being with Majnun for two more years was more than Layla could bear.
They had been separated for a lifetime and two more years of solitude, two more years without seeing her
beloved, was enough to cause the young woman to give up on life. Layla died of a broken heart, alone in her
home without ever seeing Majnun again.
News of Layla’s death reached Majnun in the wilderness. He immediately travelled to the place where
Layla had been buried and there he wept and wept until he too surrendered to the impossible grief and died at
the graveside of his one true love.
‘I pass by these walls, the walls of Layla
And kiss this wall and that wall.
It’s not love of the houses that has taken my heart
but of the One who dwells in those houses.’

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>The speaker says that, wandering like a cloud floating above hills and valleys, he encountered a field of daffodils beside a lake. The speaker says that a poet could not help but be happy in such a joyful company of flowers. He says that he stared and stared, but did not realize what wealth the scene would bring him. For now, whenever he feels “vacant” or “pensive,” the memory flashes upon “that inward eye / That is the bliss of solitude,” and his heart fills with pleasure, “and dances with the daffodils.” - Sparknotes</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>Penulis mengibaratkan dirinya bagai awan, sendirian, melayang di atas hamparan bunga. Ini yang dimaksud loneliness.</p><p></p><p>Dia sendirian tapi merasa bahagia dan tenang karena ditemani pemandangan bunga. Ini solitude.</p><p></p><p>Di padang bunga itu, ada banyak bunga daffodils/bakung. Meski dia sebagai awan sendirian, dia ditemani banyak bunga. Ini crowd.</p><p></p><p>Host mungkin maksudnya cloud. Dia manusia yang  perasaannya diwakilkan oleh perumpamaan cloud.</p><p></p><p>"Like a cloud" di kalimat itu mengandung makna konotasi, maksudnya perasaannya ringan bagai awan, dan dia awalnya tdk sadar akan apa yang dia punya sampai menemukan padang bunga yang indah, lalu merasa bahagia setelah sadar.</p><p></p><p>CMIIW.</p><br />

                            5. secara umum ruang personal (individu)sangat mempengaruhi keberadaan a.anonymity b.pernonality c. privasi d. solitude​</h2><br />
                        <p>Jawaban yang tepat adalah <strong>c. privasi.</strong></p><p></p><p>Ruang personal atau lingkungan individu dapat sangat mempengaruhi privasi seseorang. Privasi merujuk pada hak seseorang untuk menjaga informasi pribadi mereka tetap rahasia atau terhindar dari intervensi atau pengawasan oleh pihak ketiga. Ruang personal yang cukup atau terjaga dapat memberikan individu lebih banyak privasi, karena mereka memiliki kendali atas informasi pribadi mereka dan terhindar dari gangguan eksternal.</p><p></p><p><strong>A. Anonymity</strong> (anonimitas) merujuk pada keadaan tidak dikenali atau tidak diketahui identitas seseorang. Hal ini bisa terjadi dalam ruang personal yang terjaga, di mana individu bisa merasa lebih anonim dan memiliki kendali lebih besar atas pengungkapan identitas mereka.</p><p></p><p><strong>B. Personality</strong> (kepribadian) adalah karakteristik bawaan atau sifat-sifat unik yang dimiliki oleh individu, dan tidak secara langsung terkait dengan ruang personal. Meskipun ruang personal dapat mempengaruhi cara individu mengekspresikan kepribadian mereka, tetapi tidak secara langsung mempengaruhi kepribadian itu sendiri.</p><p></p><p><strong>D. Solitude</strong> (kesendirian) merujuk pada kondisi di mana seseorang berada dalam keadaan sendirian atau terisolasi dari orang lain. Meskipun ruang personal dapat memberikan kesempatan untuk solitude, tetapi solitude itu sendiri tidak langsung dipengaruhi oleh ruang personal.</p><p></p><p>Oleh karena itu, secara umum, ruang personal (individu) sangat mempengaruhi privasi, karena dapat memberikan kontrol dan keamanan terhadap informasi pribadi seseorang.</p><br />

I think I enjoyed my solitude between the Grade 8 or 9 .When I was in junior high school I was introduced to anime, and I was also introduced to various android games. The android games that helped me and who gave me various experiences were iruna online . From anime I know many things and from iruna online I also know a lot of things too. When I junior high I follow extracurricular called PMR, at the same time I follow jiu jitsu. his training schedule is not on the same day and his training is not difficult. Until one day my body condition decreased and I did not go to school. In the end I decided to get out of pmr and jiu jitsu. I did not know my decision was true or not and when my classmate was with my friend pmr.when I knew we were going to camp I planned to tell him the reason why i resigned. but we are not camping and I never mention it.

                            14. I Wandered Lonely as a Cloudby William Wordsworth (1770-1850)I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high o'er vales and hills,When all at once I saw a crowd, A host, of golden daffodils,Beside the lake, beneath the trees,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.Continuous as the stars that shine And twinkle on the milk way,They stretched in never-ending lineAlong the margin of a bay:Ten thousand saw I at a glance, Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.The waves beside them danced; but theyOut-did the sparkling waves in glee; A poet could not but be gay, In such a jocund company; I gazed and gazed but little thoughtWhat wealth the show to me had brought:For oft, when on my couch I lieIn vacant or in pensive mood, They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the daffodils.Answer the questions based on the poem above: 1. Excerpt two lines that contain simile! What comparisons does the poet make?2. Excerpt two lines that contain personification and describe what things are made human?3.

It's by someone called Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Have you read it? It's quite a well-known book ... It's been made into a film, actually. It's about this family who have all these problems and about the history of this town called Macondo. I think I read that it's based on Marquez's own life. People say it's amazing, but actually I found it boring. It has hundreds of names and people and it just goes on and on. I won't spoil the ending because ... Well ...

Mangroveshave special aerial roots and salt-filtering tap rootswhich enable them to thrive in brackish water. Brackishwater is salty but not as salty as sea water. Mangrovetrees are commonly planted and found in coastal areas.Mangroves can serve as walls of protection fornatural disaster in coastal area like tsunami. Healthymangrove forests had helped save lives in the Asiadisaster tsunami and people tended to respect thesenatural barriers even more, especially after the tsunamiThere are several species of mangrove tree found allover the world. Some prefer more salinity, while otherslike to be very close to a large freshwater source such asriver. Some prefer areas that are sheltered from waves.Some species have their roots covered with sea waterevery day during high tide. Other species grow on dryland but are still part of the ecosystem. The times ofIndia reported that rare species of mangrove had beenfound and was also known as the looking glass tree,probably because the leaves are silver-coatedMangroves need to keep their trunk and leaveabove the surface of the water. Yet they also need to befirmly attached to the ground so they are not moved bywaves. Any part of root that appears above the waterflows oxygen to the plant under water surface.

Daffodils by William Wordsworth
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed--and gazed--but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought
For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.

THE STORY OF LAYLA AND MAJNUN
Qays ibn al-Mulawwah was just a boy when he fell deeply in love with Layla Al-Aamiriya. He was sure of
this love on the very first day he laid eyes upon her at school. He soon began to write beautiful love poems about
Layla and he would read them out loud on street corners to anybody who would care to listen. Such passionate
displays of love and devotion caused many to refer to the boy as Majnun, meaning madman.
One day, Majnun found the courage to ask Layla’s father for his daughter’s hand in marriage, but her
father refused the request. Such a marriage, the father reasoned, would only cause a scandal. It would not be
proper for his daughter to marry a person whom everybody called 'madman'. Instead, Layla was promised to
another.
Majnun was overcome with grief and abandoned his home and family and disappeared into the
wilderness. He lived a miserable life of solitude among the wild animals, spending his days composing poems to
his beloved Layla. Layla was forced to marry another man and, although she did not love him because her heart
still belonged to Majnun, she remained a faithful wife.
The news of this marriage was devastating to Majnun who continued to live a life of solitude, refusing to
return home to his mother and father in the city.
Majnun’s mother and father missed their son terribly and longed every day for his safe return home.
They would leave food for him at the bottom of the garden in the hopes that one day he would come back to
them out of the desert. But Majnun remained in the wilderness, writing his poetry in solitude, never speaking to
a single soul.
Majnun spent all of his time alone, surrounded only by the animals of the wilderness that gathered
around him and protected him during the long desert nights. He was often seen by travellers who would pass
him on their way towards the city. The travellers said that Majnun spent his days reciting poetry to himself and
writing in the sand with a long stick; they said that he truly was driven to madness with a broken heart.
Many years later, Majnun’s father and mother both passed away. Knowing of his devotion to his parents,
Layla was determined to send Majnun word of their passing. Eventually she found an old man who claimed to
5
have seen Majnun in the desert. After much begging and pleading the old man agreed to pass on a message the
next time he set off on his travels.
One day, the old man crossed paths with Majnun in the desert. There he solemnly delivered the news
concerning the death of Majnun’s parents and was forced to witness what a terrible blow this was to the young
poet.
Overcome with regret and loss, Majnun cut himself off from the world entirely and vowed to live in the
desert until his own death.
Some years later, Layla’s husband died. The young woman hoped that finally she would be with her one
true love; that finally she and Majnun would be together forever. But sadly, this was not to be. Tradition
demanded that Layla remain in her home alone to grieve for her dead husband for two whole years without
seeing another soul. The thought of not being with Majnun for two more years was more than Layla could bear.
They had been separated for a lifetime and two more years of solitude, two more years without seeing her
beloved, was enough to cause the young woman to give up on life. Layla died of a broken heart, alone in her
home without ever seeing Majnun again.
News of Layla’s death reached Majnun in the wilderness. He immediately travelled to the place where
Layla had been buried and there he wept and wept until he too surrendered to the impossible grief and died at
the graveside of his one true love.
‘I pass by these walls, the walls of Layla
And kiss this wall and that wall.
It’s not love of the houses that has taken my heart
but of the One who dwells in those houses.’

them out of the desert. But Majnun remained in the wilderness, writing his poetry in solitude, never speaking to
a single soul.
Majnun spent all of his time alone, surrounded only by the animals of the wilderness that gathered
around him and protected him during the long desert nights. He was often seen by travellers who would pass
him on their way towards the city. The travellers said that Majnun spent his days reciting poetry to himself and
writing in the sand with a long stick; they said that he truly was driven to madness with a broken heart.
Many years later, Majnun’s father and mother both passed away. Knowing of his devotion to his parents,
Layla was determined to send Majnun word of their passing. Eventually she found an old man who claimed to
5
have seen Majnun in the desert. After much begging and pleading the old man agreed to pass on a message the
next time he set off on his travels.
One day, the old man crossed paths with Majnun in the desert. There he solemnly delivered the news
concerning the death of Majnun’s parents and was forced to witness what a terrible blow this was to the young
poet.
Overcome with regret and loss, Majnun cut himself off from the world entirely and vowed to live in the
desert until his own death.
Some years later, Layla’s husband died. The young woman hoped that finally she would be with her one
true love; that finally she and Majnun would be together forever. But sadly, this was not to be. Tradition
demanded that Layla remain in her home alone to grieve for her dead husband for two whole years without
seeing another soul. The thought of not being with Majnun for two more years was more than Layla could bear.
They had been separated for a lifetime and two more years of solitude, two more years without seeing her
beloved, was enough to cause the young woman to give up on life. Layla died of a broken heart, alone in her
home without ever seeing Majnun again.
News of Layla’s death reached Majnun in the wilderness. He immediately travelled to the place where
Layla had been buried and there he wept and wept until he too surrendered to the impossible grief and died at
the graveside of his one true love.
‘I pass by these walls, the walls of Layla
And kiss this wall and that wall.
It’s not love of the houses that has taken my heart
but of the One who dwells in those houses.’
